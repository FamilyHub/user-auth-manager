## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Email Verification Flow  

### **Steps Followed**
1. **Set Up SMTP for Sending Emails:**  
   - Configured an SMTP provider (e.g., Gmail SMTP, SendGrid).  
   - Obtained SMTP credentials (host, port, username, and password).  
   - Enabled **less secure app access** or generated an **app password** (if required).

2. **Generate and Store Verification Tokens:**  
   - When a user registers, a unique verification token is generated.  
   - The token is stored in the database along with an expiration time.

3. **Send Verification Email:**  
   - Constructed an email containing a **verification link**.  
   - The link redirects users to an endpoint where the token is validated.

4. **Verify the Token:**  
   - When the user clicks the verification link, the token is retrieved and validated.  
   - If valid, the user‚Äôs email is marked as **verified** in the system.

### **Steps Followed**
1. **Set Up Twilio for OTP Service:**  
   - Created a **Twilio account**.  
   - Obtained **Account SID** and **Auth Token** from the Twilio Console.  
   - Created a **Twilio Verify Service** and retrieved the **Service SID**.

2. **Generate OTP and Send SMS:**  
   - When a user requests OTP login, a random OTP is generated.  
   - Twilio's API is used to send the OTP to the user‚Äôs registered mobile number.  

3. **User Enters OTP for Verification:**  
   - The system verifies the OTP entered by the user against the one sent.  
   - If the OTP is correct, authentication is successful.  

4. **Enhancing Personalization in OTP Messages:**  
   - Customized the OTP message to make it more user-friendly (e.g., adding the user‚Äôs name or a friendly greeting).  
   - Ensured that OTP messages included a warning against sharing the OTP.
